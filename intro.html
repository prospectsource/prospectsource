SERVICING COLLEGE BASKETBALL PROSPECTS

AAU Prospects
Our service is built to help AAU athletes through the recruiting process. We believe the recruiting process is complex and it is ultimately up to the athlete to perform on and off the court in order to have the opportunity to play college basketball. We service our athletes all year round as we prepare them for college basketball. During the fall and winter months we want our athletes utilizing all the resources offered at their respective high school. During the spring and summer, we offer additional resources through their respective AAU program to make sure athletes are doing everything possible to reach their goals. For many this simply means education on the process and information dissemination. For other athletes, this is a more in depth development opportunity as we help our athletes become physically and mentally prepared to perform.

Consulting Service

JUCO Prospects (KEEP THIS HIDDEN FOR NOW, DONâ€™T WANT TO SHOW THIS YET)

Our service is built to come alongside NJCAA coaching staffs to help their athletes in the transfer process. As athletes prepare for the transfer process, we help them disseminate information across the country in search of the right opportunity at the NCAA level. Our goal with NJCAA programs is to empower the coaching staff and their athletes, making their processes more powerful and efficient.  

Service Overview

SERVICING COLLEGE BASKETBALL PROGRAMS

NCAA (Division I, II, III), NAIA, NJCAA
Our goal is to help college basketball programs of all levels improve their prospect discovery process. We make sure college coaches have the necessary information, video, and relationships to easily identify relevant prospects at AAU Programs across the country. We understand college coaches cannot see every athlete live, therefore we work to make sure they have a resource to identify prospects who would be a good fit for their program.
